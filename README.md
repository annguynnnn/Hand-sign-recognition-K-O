# ✋ Hand Sign Recognition (Letters **K–O**)

A compact project for recognizing hand signs **K → O** with deep learning.  
Build **three** models and compare their accuracy: a **Custom CNN**, **MobileNetV2**, and **ResNet-50**.

## 🧠 Models
- **Custom CNN** (self-designed)
- **MobileNetV2**
- **ResNet-50**

## 📊 Results
| Model        | Validation Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
|--------------|--------------------:|--------------:|
| ResNet-50    | **84.37%**          | **96.19%**    |
| MobileNetV2  | **86.01%**          | **95.79%**    |
| Custom CNN   | **87.23%**          | **97.52%**    |

🏆 **Highlight:** The **Custom CNN** achieved the highest accuracy on both validation (**87.23%**) and test (**97.52%**) sets.
